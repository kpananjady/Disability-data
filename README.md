An analysis of a database of disability support payments in the state of California does not reveal evidence of racial discrimination among white and Hispanic participants in the sample. 

The Department of Developmental Services in California oversees the disbursement of funds to over 250,000 individuals with developmental disabilities. This analysis was performed on 1,000 of those records, and as such cannot be generalized to the entire database. 

The two largest groups with the sample by race were whites and Hispanics, comprising 40 and 37 percent of entries, respectively. A rudimentary analysis of government expenditures reveals a startling disparity: People of Hispanic origin receive $11,000 less than whites do. However, this disparity is not necessarily evidence of discrimination.

When the data is disaggregated into age cohorts, we actually discover that median government expenditures on white and Hispanic people do not often differ by much — and when they do, Hispanic people receive higher median aid. Age brackets as provided in the dataset range from 0-5, 6-12, 13-17, 18-21, 22-50 and 51+.

The analysis is a classic example of Simpson’s paradox, whereby a global trend disappears on disaggregation by a reasonable axis. One of the better known examples of Simpson’s paradox is the case of gender discrimination in Berkeley admissions. On the one hand, a university-wide analysis of admissions rates revealed a disparity in the likelihood and men and women being admitted, with men registering a higher rate. However, when admit rates were considered on a department by department basis, the trend seemed to favor women. Simpson’s paradox arises because we tend to consider percentage differences in disaggregated data, but depending on the raw numbers in each category the overall picture painted might be completely different.

In the case of Department of Developmental Services data, age is a reasonable metric by which to disaggregate the data since it is strongly correlated with government expenditure, registering a Pearson coefficient of 0.8. While this does not prove a causal effect, the next step in this analysis would be to investigate the criteria for the disbursement of funds to see how age is weighted and to explain why the cohort categories are determined as they are.
